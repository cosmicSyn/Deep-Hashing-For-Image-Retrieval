# Deep-Hashing-For-Image-Retrieval

### Abstract
In recent years, hashing has been widely applied for large-scale image retrieval. Making the hash function data dependent can greatly improve the hashing quality. Deep hashing methods have been proposed to perform simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning with deep neural networks, which have shown better performance than traditional hashing methods.  This project explores the application of deep hashing techniques, specifically using a novel loss function—OrthoHash combined with Mean Square Error (MSE)—to enhance the performance of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). This combined loss function can provide a tighter clustering of the generated hash codes. Extensive testing on common image classification datasets has shown that the combined loss function shows improvement over only using cosine similarity as a loss function.
